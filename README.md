#MASK DETECTION DURING THIS CORONA PANDEMIC
 1. First of all i will list all the resources and links for my dataset which i used in training my custom model.
 2. link for Dataset- Train - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UPslRXg0us1q0q3eCrrcMa9SSXmAge7t?usp=sharing
                      Test -  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qQWV8Iy3-Q0uXkjDQpZ9TeXiLFJ4GEX3?usp=sharing
 3. My dataset is divided into two folders Train and Test folder with images and their corresponding annotations in PASCAL VOC or COCO dataset format.
 4 . Just upload this data to  your drive so that u can follow my notebook code ....
 5. SO, here are some resources from where you can get a idea on custom object deetction and Facebook's Detectron2 Framework as given below-
   Detectron2 Github - https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2
   Documentation of Detectron2 - https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/
   Another github link of Tanner gilbert's Repo a very big thnk for him for this repo its really helpful - https://github.com/TannerGilbert/Microcontroller-Detection-with-Detectron2
   
  6. now the link of my Pretrained model which u can use directly through my notebook just upload it also to your drive so that it can be used later on in your colab notebook
    link- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vJ9sAUZPzdnrcf9m9zpV2b-9zss7Ph0l/view?usp=sharing
